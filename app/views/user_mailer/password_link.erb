Hi,

<p>To choose a new password, click this link (valid for one hour):</p>

<p><%= link_to "Click for a new password", new_password_user_url(@user.confirm_token) %></p>

<ul>
	<li>At least 11 characters</li>
	<li>At least one capital letter</li>
	<li>At least one space</li>
	<li>Pass phrases are easier to remember for humans and more secure</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">This cartoon</a> explains it well
		and here is <a href="http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php">a password strength tool</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		You can choose a <strong>simple human pass phrase</strong> instead of a confusing group of letters 
		generated by a computer: "$400 Chorizo Is Expensive" or "I like swimming in Spain".
		Be as creative as you like.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If you did not request this e-mail, just ignore it and your current password will continue to work.</p>

<p>Kindest regards,</p>
